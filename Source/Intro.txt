Welcome to our kingdom, brave man.

A destroyed kingdom.

As the story goes,

The kingdom was a happy kingdom all around.

A wizard had come from nowhere, who had powerful abilities and magic.

He kept everyone happy, supplying everyone with what they needed.

But suddenly, he betrayed us.

He took his magical powers and destroyed everything, spread his 
evil infestation everywhere.

he spread monsters everywhere, even some of our knights.

You, brave man... will have to save us.

You are our only hope. We trust in you.

go, show that wizard what you have!
